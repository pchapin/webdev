Web Development
===============

This repository is a collection of unrelated web development experiments. It serves as a sandbox
for exploring new technologies and web development techniques. The primary purpose of this
repository is educational.

The number of web development technologies is vast. What is being explored here is a tiny
fraction of the possibilities. This repository may grow in size and scope as more technologies
are added.

Here is a list of technologies being explored so far. There are IDE configurations in each of
the subfolders, as suited for the technology being explored in that subfolder. See the READMEs
in the various subfolders for more information.

+ DOCTYPE. This folder contains subfolders focusing on various document types (HTML, SVG,
  MathML, etc.). They grouped under the DOCTYPE folder so they can share common IDE
  configurations.
  
+ JavaScript. This refers to pure JavaScript (as opposed to a JavaScript framework) used in the
  context of frontend development.
  
+ Node. This is about JavaScript used in the context of backend development.

+ PHP. This folder is about PHP backends.
  
+ Tomcat. This folder is about the Tomcat application server and some of the technologies it
  supports, notably Java Server Pages and Java Servlets.
