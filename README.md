Web Development
===============

This repository is a collection of unrelated web development projects. It serves as a sandbox
for experimenting with new technologies and techniques. Its primary purpose is educational. It
is not a serious attempt to create a production-ready web application.

The number of web-related technologies is vast. What is being explored here is a tiny fraction
of the possibilities. This repository may grow in size and scope as more technologies are added.
Stay tuned!

Here is a list of technologies explored so far. See the READMEs in the various subfolders for
more information about each.

+ JavaScript. This refers to pure JavaScript (as opposed to a JavaScript framework) used in the
  front end.
  
+ SVG. This focuses on all things SVG.

+ Tomcat. This folder is about the Tomcat application server and some of the technologies it
  supports, notably Java Server Pages and Java Servlets.
