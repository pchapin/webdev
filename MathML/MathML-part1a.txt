Subject: [vtc3] Quick follow-up on MathML rendering.


I attempted to send an email message to Mozilla's email client to see if I
could get it to render MathML in such messages. My tests were failures.

I hand composed the message headers to be sure I was in control of what
was being sent. For my first test I used a MIME type of
application/xhtml+xml. Mozilla's email client showed the body of the
message as an attachment. When I told it to open the attachment it said
that it didn't know how to handle application/xhtml+xml. That seemed
strange since it clearly does know how to handle that MIME type when
rendering web pages.

In my second test I tried text/html. Mozilla's email client showed the
message okay, but ignored the MathML markup (ignored the tags and showed
me the contents "raw"). In my final test I tried text/xml but that message
never arrived at my sover.net address. I wonder if sover.net's
configuration of Spam Assassin eliminated the message as potential spam. I
guess not many legitimate messages are being sent as text/xml at this
point.

All in all I was disappointed. Clearly the rendering being done in email
messages is not 100% identical to that done during the handling of web
pages. I suspect that there currently does not exist an email program that
can render MathML in email messages (using the mixed document approach
sanctioned by the W3C, at least).
