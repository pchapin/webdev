# Node Body of Knowledge

This folder contains my sandbox of Node.js experiments and learning exercises. Some of this code
is for backend web development, but some is more about using JavaScript as a scripting language
or application development language.

There are IDE configuration files for WebStorm and Visual Studio code in this folder.
