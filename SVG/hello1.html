<!--
This document illustrates how to enbed SVG into HTML. The embedded document is somewhat isolated
from the enclosing document, but it is still possible to style it independently by including styling
information in the SVG file. It is also possible to manipulate the DOM of the SVG from JavaScript
in the enclosing document by asking the `object` element for its DOM as a separate operation.
