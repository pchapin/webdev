Named Colors
------------

The following color names are suggested by the CSS specification. All
known browsers suppor them. Browsers may (and often do) support many
additional color names. However, the use of such names is less portable
than sticking to these. Note also that the color values for the names
here are defined in the specification. Other color names may have
varying color values as you move from browser to browser.

aqua
gray
navy
silver
black
green
olive
teal
blue
lime
purple
white
fuchsia
maroon
red
yellow
